# Waste Segregator

Waste Classification and Segregation Using Machine learning

This project aims to segregate the waste into two catagories: Bio and Non-Bio.It is executed using the combination of machine learning and electronics. It is able to achieve an accuracy of 85%. 
In order to train the model, CNN has been used. The project has been implemented using Keras and Arduino.

OPERATION :1) Run the sketch onto the arduino
           2) Connect Arduino
           3) Run CV.py
           4) The output will be in form of a label(BIO, NONBIO)
